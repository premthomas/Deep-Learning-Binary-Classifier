# Deep Learning (Binary Classifier) 
## With custom data (Kevin and Stuart from Minions)

### Objective
You want to understand 'Deep learning'. Your search will almost always take you to the famous dataset: 'Dogs vs. Cats'. One of the better tutorials can be found here. (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification). You implement the example and the results match the documentation. Very rarely, does a well documented example like 'Dogs vs. Cats can go wrong. The data was collected and cleaned perfectly to get you the same results all the time. 

If you replace this dataset with one of your own, what would it look like? How much more effort would you have to put in? Would changing this example tutorial to use your dataset be extremely difficult? 

In this repository, I have created 5 programs. Each program explains one step of the process and ends with predicting for your data and checking the accuracies. 

### The environment
Executing a project inside an environment is not only a best practice but safe as upgrades do not hinder the execution in the future. The following commands are to be executed from the Anaconda command prompt.

Create the environment by using the command:`conda create --name <name of the environment> tensorflow-gpu`
  
Activate the environment by using the command:`conda activate <name of the environment>`

Install the following libraries using the `pip install`command
 - os
 - cv2
 - shutil
 - glob
 - pillow
 - random
 - matplotlib
 - sklearn
 - jupyter
 
 Now your environment is complete to execute the programs found in this repository.
